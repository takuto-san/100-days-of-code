# 100 Days Of Code - Learning Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
I studied Unittest and Logging from the course [Python 3 Introduction + Application + Silicon Valley Coding Style Taught by an Active Silicon Valley Engineer](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-beginner/).

**Thoughts**  
I learned the basics, such as how using `pytest` can make test code simpler and more convenient, the relationship between error levels and logging, and how to pass loggers to other modules.

### Day 2: April 28, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
Based on what I studied yesterday, I wrote code by myself to review and deepen my understanding. Specifically, I created a simple class to implement payment functionality, and wrote test cases using both `unittest` and `pytest`. I also successfully output logs to a file using `logging` and `logger`.

**Reflections**  
I realized that while watching Udemy videos, I only *felt* like I understood the concepts. By actually writing code myself while asking ChatGPT questions, I was able to gain a much deeper understanding of how to use the concepts in practice.

### Day 3: April 29, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
Today, I built the core domain models for a group payment and bill-splitting system.  
Specifically, I defined data models such as `User`, `Payment`, `Asset`, and `Debt`, and created collection classes to manage lists of these models.  
I also implemented logic to summarize and resolve user debts and assets safely using Pydantic.

**Reflections**  
Designing the domain layer from scratch made me realize how important it is to think deeply about data structures and responsibility separation.  
It also helped me better understand how to build a solid foundation for future API and frontend integrations.

### Day 4: April 30, 2025

**Progress**  
Edited the schema for payments and settlements, and added logic to calculate balances and generate settlements.  
Now the system can automatically determine who should pay how much to whom based on all users' payment history.

**Thoughts**  
I struggled with Pydanticâ€”it was hard to follow how types were enforced in data passing throughout the code.

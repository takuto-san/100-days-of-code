# 100 Days Of Code - Learning Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
I studied Unittest and Logging from the course [Python 3 Introduction + Application + Silicon Valley Coding Style Taught by an Active Silicon Valley Engineer](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-beginner/).

**Thoughts**  
I learned the basics, such as how using `pytest` can make test code simpler and more convenient, the relationship between error levels and logging, and how to pass loggers to other modules.

### Day 2: April 28, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
Based on what I studied yesterday, I wrote code by myself to review and deepen my understanding. Specifically, I created a simple class to implement payment functionality, and wrote test cases using both `unittest` and `pytest`. I also successfully output logs to a file using `logging` and `logger`.

**Reflections**  
I realized that while watching Udemy videos, I only *felt* like I understood the concepts. By actually writing code myself while asking ChatGPT questions, I was able to gain a much deeper understanding of how to use the concepts in practice.

# 100 Days Of Code - Learning Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2025

**Today's Progress**  
I studied Unittest and Logging from the course [Python 3 Introduction + Application + Silicon Valley Coding Style Taught by an Active Silicon Valley Engineer](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-beginner/).

**Thoughts**  
I learned the basics, such as how using `pytest` can make test code simpler and more convenient, the relationship between error levels and logging, and how to pass loggers to other modules.
